sndfilter
=========

Algorithms for simple sound filters, like lowpass, highpass, notch, etc.

It's easy to find countless math equations on sound filters, but a bit harder to find simple source
code.  This library is my attempt at cleaning up and presenting the math-heavy filter algorithms for
the programming community.
